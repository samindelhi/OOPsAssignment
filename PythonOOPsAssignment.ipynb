        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data (attributes) and methods (functions). It emphasizes encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction for better code organization and reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP\n",
        "  - A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that the objects will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP\n",
        "  - An object is an instance of a class that holds specific values for attributes and can perform actions using its methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n",
        "   - **Abstraction** hides implementation details and exposes only relevant functionality.\n",
        "   - **Encapsulation** restricts direct access to data by bundling attributes and methods together within a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python\n",
        "  - \"Dunder\" (double underscore) methods like ```__init__(), __str__(), and __add__()``` provide special behaviors in Python, including object construction, string representation, and operator overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "  - Inheritance allows a class (child) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent), enabling code reuse and extension.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP\n",
        "  - Polymorphism allows different classes to have methods with the same name but different implementations, enabling flexibility in object behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python\n",
        "  - Encapsulation is achieved using private (__var) and protected (_var) attributes, which restrict access to class internals while using getter/setter methods for controlled modification\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python\n",
        "  - A constructor ```__init__()``` is a special method in Python that initializes a new object when a class is instantiated\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python\n",
        "    - Class methods (@classmethod) operate on class attributes and take cls as the first parameter.\n",
        "    - Static methods (@staticmethod) don’t rely on instance or class attributes and behave like regular functions inside a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python\n",
        "    - Python does not support traditional method overloading, but you can achieve similar behavior using default arguments or *args/**kwargs in methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "    - Method overriding allows a subclass to redefine a method from its parent class, providing a new implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python\n",
        "  - The @property decorator allows getter methods to be accessed like attributes, improving readability and controlling data access.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP\n",
        "  - Polymorphism improves flexibility, scalability, and code organization, allowing different objects to be used interchangeably in a unified interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python\n",
        "  - An abstract class (defined using ABC and @abstractmethod) enforces method implementation in subclasses, ensuring consistency in behavior\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP\n",
        "    - Code reusability (inheritance)\n",
        "    - Better organization (encapsulation)\n",
        "    - Flexibility (polymorphism)\n",
        "    - Improved maintainability (modular design)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is multiple inheritance in Python\n",
        "  - Multiple inheritance in Python allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class, enabling code reuse and flexibility. It is implemented by listing multiple base classes in the class definition, like:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  ``` class Child(Parent1, Parent2):```\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable\n",
        "  - A class variable is shared among all instances of a class and is defined outside methods, whereas an instance variable is unique to each object and is defined inside the __init__() method using self.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ```'__str__' and '__repr__'``` methods in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Both ```__str__() and __repr__()``` are special methods in Python that define how objects are converted into strings. The key difference is their intended audience:\n",
        "\n",
        "|   Method   |   Purpose|\n",
        "  |:------:|:-------|\n",
        "  | __str__() | Provides a user-friendly string representation (for print()). |\n",
        "  | __repr__() | Provides a developer-friendly representation, useful for debugging. |\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the 'super()' function in Python\n",
        "  - The super() function in Python is used for calling methods from a parent class in inheritance. It allows subclasses to access and extend methods from their parent class without directly referencing them.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the ```__del__``` method in Python\n",
        "  - The ```__del__()``` method is a special method in Python known as the destructor. It is called when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., garbage collected).\n",
        "  Purpose of ```__del__ method```:\n",
        "  - Automatic cleanup → Helps free up resources like file handles, network connections, or memory allocations.\n",
        "  - Final actions before deletion → Can log information or release external dependencies.\n",
        "  - Garbage collection behavior → When an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted using del obj, Python calls ```__del__()```.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance\n",
        "  - Polymorphism in Python allows methods in different classes to have the same name but behave differently. When combined with inheritance, polymorphism enables subclasses to override a method from the parent class while maintaining a consistent interface.\n",
        "  - Let’s say we have a Shape base class, with subclasses Circle and Rectangle, each implementing their own version of area().\n",
        "  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "  - Method chaining is a technique in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single statement. This improves readability and reduces redundant variable assignments.\n",
        "```    \n",
        "\"This is a test to see method chaining in action. \".split(' ').index('method') #Output is 8\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, the __call__() method allows an instance of a class to be invoked like a function. This means that when an object is called using parentheses (), the __call__() method is executed.\n",
        "```\n",
        "eg:     def __call__(self, number):\n",
        "        return number * self.factor\n",
        "```\n"
